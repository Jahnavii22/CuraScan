    "Repeat a complete blood count (CBC) to verify results and rule out potential technical issues or sample artifacts.",
    "Further specific tests (e.g., iron studies, peripheral blood smear) will likely be needed to clarify the underlying diagnosis for the red blood cell abnormalities.",
    "Discuss with your doctor about dietary changes, such as reducing intake of sugars and unhealthy fats, to help manage triglyceride levels.",
    "Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine to support healthy lipid levels."
