    "Consult with a physician to evaluate red blood cell indices (MCHC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit) due to conflicting and abnormal results.",
    "Further investigation, including a repeat Complete Blood Count (CBC) and blood film review, is strongly recommended due to the MCHC, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit discrepancies.",
    "Increase daily water intake to ensure adequate hydration, which may influence Urea levels.",
    "Review dietary protein intake with a healthcare provider, as high protein can elevate Urea.",
    "Discuss elevated Hemoglobin with your physician to investigate potential causes such as dehydration, smoking, or underlying conditions.",
    "Adopt a diet low in saturated and trans fats, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to help manage LDL levels.",
    "Engage in regular physical activity (e.g., 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days) to support cardiovascular health and LDL management."
